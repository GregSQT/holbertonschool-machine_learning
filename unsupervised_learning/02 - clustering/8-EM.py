    Perform the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
    for a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

    Args:
        X (numpy.ndarray): Data points of shape (n_samples, n_features).
        k (int): Number of clusters.
        iterations (int): Maximum number of iterations for the algorithm.
        tol (float): Tolerance of the log likelihood, used for early stopping.
        verbose (bool): Determines if information about
        the algorithm should be printed.

    Returns:
        Tuple[numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray, numpy.
        ndarray, numpy.ndarray, float]:
        - updated_priors (numpy.ndarray):
        Updated priors for each cluster of shape (k,).

        means for each cluster of shape (k, n_features).
        - updated_covariances (numpy.ndarray): Updated covariance matrices
        for each cluster of shape (k, n_features, n_features).
        - posterior_probs (numpy.ndarray): Probabilities for each
        data point in each cluster of shape (k, n_samples).
        - log_likelihood (float): Log likelihood of the model.

    Returns (None, None, None, None, None) on failure.
